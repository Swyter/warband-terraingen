# warband-terraingen

`@cmpxchg8b`'s `TerrainGen` code; generates a scene mesh from their respective terrain code, just like _Mount&Blade: Warband_ does.

Originally released on Apr 10, 2012 and thought to be lost. Recovered from a raw corrupted disk via hex editor pattern search. The filenames are no longer visible, so they are renamed to mirror the original file structure and kept here for posterity.

It should build on Windows, right out of be box with MSVC.
